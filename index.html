<p class="title is-3 mb-5 mt-6">Motivation</p>

<p class="has-text-justified">The availability of numerical guidance from NWP models has been an important component of operational forecasting for decades. For many, the output from this numerical guidance was produced by a mysterious “black box”. Rules for using and adjusting the guidance for operational forecasters were often subjective “Rules of Thumb” based on experience rather than based on quantitative analysis.</p>
<p class="has-text-justified">To open up this “black box”, we produced this web-based “Operational Model Encyclopedia” linking both generic information on how NWP models work, and specifics on physical parameterizations, dynamics, and data assimilation in operational models. Ensemble Prediction systems and Marine Wave models are included as well.  New model descriptions are updated as operational models are updated.</p>
